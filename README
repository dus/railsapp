Small demo for rails using docker (for development, for staging/production), without loss of connections, even when updating gems.

Prerequisites:
- have docker installed (to run the containers)
  # you should be able to run "docker run hello-world"
- have docker compose installed (to run multiple containers, and define the dependencies between them)

bootstrapping the container (first time running rails):
- docker-compose run web rails new . --force --database=postgresql
- as root: chown -R <user>:<group> . #TODO: integrate this
- if need to rebuild: docker-compose build
- if need to run: docker-compose run
- if need to shutdown cleanly: docker-compose down


# WARNING: Image for service web was built because it did not already exist. To rebuild this image you must use `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up --build`.

# manually build a container:
docker build -t friendlyname 
docker images
docker run <image>

if see "Switch to inspect mode.", do:
- docker run -it <image>
